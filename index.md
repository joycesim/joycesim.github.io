Hi, Welcome to the Sim Lab! I am Dr Shi Joyce Sim, an assistant professor at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am looking for motivated and enthusiastic students/postdocs who are interested in applying fluid dynamics (physics, math and numerical modeling) to geologic problems. Come join us!

At SimLab, we strongly support diversity, equity, and inclusion, with respect to race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, gender identity, disability status, religion, and socioeconomic background. We strive to build a healthy scientific community where scientists of any backgrounds are welcomed and respected. Come learn with us!
