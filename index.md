Hi, Welcome to the Sim Lab! I am Dr Shi Joyce Sim, a research scientist at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am looking for motivated and enthusiastic students/postdocs who are interested in applying fluid dynamics (physics, math and numerical modeling) to geologic problems. Come join us!
