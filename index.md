Hi, Welcome to the Sim Lab! I am Dr Shi Joyce Sim, a research scientist at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am looking for motivated and enthusiastic students/postdocs who are interested in applying fluid dynamics (physics, math and numerical modeling) to geologic problems. Come join us! 

### Diversity statement
Science flourishes in an open and inclusive culture. At SimLab, we strongly support diversity, equity, and inclusion, with respect to race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, gender identity, disability status, religion, and socioeconomic background. We strive to build a healthy scientific community where scientists of any backgrounds are welcomed and respected.  

### Land Acknowledgment
We acknowledge the Muscogee Creek and Cherokee people, who have lived on and nurtured the land on which the lab is currently situated.
