I have officially started at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Science at Georgia Institute of Technology! I am looking for motivated and enthusiastic students who are interested in applying fluid dynamics (physics, math and numerical modeling) to geologic problems! Postdocs too! Please feel free to email me.
