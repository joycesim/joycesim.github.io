Hi, I am Dr Shi Joyce Sim. I have officially started at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am looking for motivated and enthusiastic students/postdocs who are interested in applying fluid dynamics (physics, math and numerical modeling) to geologic problems. Please feel free to email me.
