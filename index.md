Hi, Welcome to the Sim Lab! I am Dr Shi Joyce Sim, an assistant professor at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am looking for motivated and enthusiastic students/postdocs who are interested in applying fluid dynamics (physics, math and numerical modeling) to geologic problems. Come join us! 

### Discovery comes from a strong inclusive vibrant community
Science flourishes in an open and inclusive culture. At SimLab, we support building a strong community based on diversity, equity, and inclusion, with respect to race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, gender identity, disability status, religion, and socioeconomic background. We strive to build a healthy scientific community where scientists of any backgrounds are welcomed and respected. Come learn with us!

### Land Acknowledgment
We acknowledge the Muscogee Creek and Cherokee people, who have lived on and nurtured the land on which the lab is currently situated. Learn more about [the Muscogee Nation](https://www.muscogeenation.com/) and [ the Cherokee Nation](https://cherokee.org/).
