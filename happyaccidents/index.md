Happy Accidents: Where Science is the canvas

Goal:
Encourage creativity
Change in perspective and an increase appreciation of models that did not work
Engage in conversation of what scientific progress looks like

Scientists are encouraged to look at their Science through an artistic lens with the goal of better understanding their Science and also gain a unique appreciation of their own work and that of others. 

The piece of art can be an original art work - painting, sculpture, scribble etc that is inspired by Science, hopefully from your own work. It can be a by-product of doing your Science, such as an image, a video, an experimental structure, math scribbles. 

As a geodynamicist, I solve equations numerically in order to understand Earth processes. This means that there are many numerical models that fail in various ways before getting to the one model that makes any sense. To understand these perceived failures, I  project them using a visualization tool (paraview) and produce images that are at times, mystifying. I have noticed that some of them trigger a certain art blob side. I “see” beautiful things in these “failures”.
