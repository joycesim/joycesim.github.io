# {{page.title}}

This document gives an idea of what is expected of you as a SimLab student, and what you can expect of Joyce as an advisor. 
Everyone is different and so is their PhD experience. 
This document is meant to be a guide that is accompanied by ongoing conversations between Joyce and yourself/your peers about your progress and goals. 

If something is not addressed below, or if you’re not sure about something, please ask!

## THE BASICS

### a)     The importance of self-motivation and independent initiative

The time commitment to research tends to be one of the most important issues for graduate students and advisors. Set specific goals and timetables for yourself. Working hard is not the same as accomplishing something (work smarter not harder). Make sure you set a goal and adjust your strategy as necessary (e.g., with teaching load, coursework, life!) to meet it.
Planning for sufficient work time takes priority. When setting meetings, appointments, office hours, or section meeting times, avoid breaking up your primary working hours. You may be a night owl or you may be a morning person (like Joyce who is also a random night owl). You have the responsibility and privilege to arrange your schedule in such a way that best suits your working style.  
Be proactive about eliminating bottlenecks to progress. Do you need to meet with someone who is generally unavailable? Shoot them an email ASAP. Meanwhile, work on other tasks at hand.
It can be difficult to know how to divide your time between reading and writing papers and your research. Most people underestimate how long writing and reading takes. 
“Time is the *only irreplaceable resource” (*except for your life and health – work efficiently, but always be safe!)

### b)    Measures of productivity – what are the benchmarks for progress?

A PhD from Georgia Tech takes ~5 years. 
Joyce will do her best to make sure that you graduate within this time frame.
Everyone except 1st year graduate students should have something new/presentable (e.g. a paper, a conference presentation, exciting results) every semester.
You will take qualifying exam at the end of the second year. 
The department requires an informal annual evaluation outlining goals and progress. 
Meet with your committee members at least once per year post qualifying exam.
You should plan on writing a manuscript-based thesis that amounts to at least 3 papers that will be submitted to journals. 
Joyce will work closely with you to plan/outline figures and content and then will review complete drafts once finished. 

### c)     Which and how many courses, and when to take them

First years typically take 2-3 courses each semester.
There are no set course list but there is a set knowledge list that you will try to take classes to fulfil for your qualifying exam in your second year.
Aim for a well-rounded education of Earth Science and classes that will help with your research. 
Joyce will be happy to discuss with you on what classes to take. 

Recommended classes:    
Earth System Modeling - 86150 - EAS 6130 - A.  
Special Topics - 93277 - EAS 8802 - COM (2 credits) - Practical Math coding course.    
Earthquake Physics - 93439 - EAS 6316 - A.   
Intro Research & Ethics - 91153 - EAS 6000 - A (1 credit).   

Required seminar (both single credit seminars):    
Seminar - 91849 - EAS 8001 - GEO.   
Geophysics Seminar - 85402 - EAS 8001 - AVN.   

### d)    How frequently to attend seminars, reading groups, and other academic activities

Required: Weekly Thursday Department seminar and Geophysics Friday seminar
Recommended: Explorigins 

### e)     Expected working hours

This is a work environment, where you are expected to be on task for the number of hours equivalent to a standard work day. In practical terms, however, you will find that the job of being a scientist does not always conform to standard hours.  
Regard graduate school as a full-time job (with room for both vacations and overtime). You should work a 40 hour work week on average in a given semester. On the subject of ‘overtime’, there will probably be times when you will need to work on weekends if a deadline is near.

### f)     Vacation policy

You will take vacations because you are being paid as a full-time graduate student. Joyce is happy to discuss longer-than-average vacations with students, depending on your particular situation. Joyce will be away in Malaysia almost annually. 
You are expected to work during academic ‘holidays’ such as reading break. However, you are not expected to work during official University holidays and recesses -- look up the Georgia Tech Academic Calendar.

### g)    Balancing formal teaching and informal outreach activities with research time

Teaching is an integral part of our education and an academic career. In semesters where you teach, you should adjust your expectations for research output.  It can be helpful to organize your time to allow at least one free day per week to work on research. 
If you’re looking for ways to get involved in community and/or affinity organizations, don’t hesitate to ask.

### h)    Conference attendance – when and where?

We tend to attend the American Geophysical Union science meeting in December or the biannual Ada Lovelace workshop in Europe.
Other conferences/workshops are the SEDI Gordon conference and European Geophysical Union (EGU). 

## ESTABLISHING LINES OF COMMUNICATION

### a)     Group Meetings/lunch – how frequently

We generally have alternating group meetings once every two weeks and group lunch once a month. 
Everyone can discuss their progress, problems, and goals during the group meetings and more informally during group lunch.
These typically last 1-1.5 hrs.
When we have new people or guests, be prepared to give your 5-minute introduction on who you are and what project you are working on.

### b)    Individual Meetings – how frequently

Each term, try to sit down together with Joyce and identify reasonable goals to be completed by the end of that term. 
Write these goals down and revisit them periodically. 
Expect weekly standing meetings that can increase or decrease in frequencies as needed. 

### c)     Email – degree of mutual accessibility – will it include after hours and/or weekends?

Please respond to emails within a few days, unless otherwise stated.
You are not expected to respond to emails outside of normal working hours (e.g., on weekends or official holidays).
Joyce will try her best to do so as well but if you have something urgent, it is usually better to use slack or call.

### d)     Emphasize the importance of regular communication (in both directions)

Sometimes, students are unclear what they should be doing early in a project. This is normal. Talk with Joyce, talk with fellow group members.
Joyce is here to develop overarching ideas and projects with you, and guide you when you run into barriers. Other members of the group are your primary resource if you need focused technical/coding help.
In academia, it is important to be open to criticism. Criticism can be a difficult aspect of a PhD; many of the things you will work on become so important to you that it can be hard to maintain perspective. Feel free to talk out edits or critiques with other group members to create a plan of action if you feel overwhelmed.
Work together to find a common agreement when conflict arises. If you ever need help with a workplace issue, talk to the labmates, but if you need further advocacy, you should reach out to the EAS admin or the ombudsperson.

## OTHERS

### a)     Funding

You will be supported for a guaranteed 5 years while in EAS, Georgia Tech. Your support will likely come from a mixture of TA/RA and fellowship funds.
Especially in your 1st year, you are expected to apply for external fellowships, for example, NASA, NSF GRFP, Hertz  (though it can be harder to find options if you are an international student).

### b)    Good practices

It is important to have strong integrity and honesty in your work – never skewing, biasing or misrepresenting results to fit a previous idea. 
Backing up your work at least once a week is also crucial. Consider backing up your organized files with a README when you’re done, so that future students can use the data. You could, for example, use Dropbox (free to Tech students) for the ease of storage and backups that allow access across multiple computers and users. You should also consider backing up your laptop/data to an external harddrive.

### c)     Note taking

Tracking and recording work is important. Taking clear notes feels boring but pays off massively later when you are writing. Use whatever you are most comfortable with to take notes during meetings.
You may want to keep a separate journal to take notes on the department seminars you attend.
You should use a citation management software, like Zotero, EndNote, or BibTeX, to manage the papers you’ve read (or will read) for each project (e.g., a class, your qualifying exam, a research project). It is very helpful to write a short summary in the notes about the paper so you don’t have to read the entire paper again down the road.

### d)    Coauthorship

You will be an author on a published paper if you have provided a substantial portion of the intellectual and physical work involved, and have completed your portion of the work satisfactorily. This involves participation both in the writing and the research work involved.
You will be first-author if you contributed the majority of the intellectual effort and completed the project, including the writing. Academics often get attached to ‘this is my idea’ and people have imperfect memories so we encourage an open dialogue about who contributed to an idea being born, developed and brought to fruition. 

## FINAL THOUGHTS

As a graduate student, you will be treated as a junior colleague who is maturing into a professional scientist. This means that you can actively co-create opportunities to meet your goals. This framework also puts a large responsibility on your shoulders to live up to the expectations of performance that are required of a colleague. As a part of your PhD, you will ideally learn: 

how to do good science along with how to do your specific project
creative problem solving and a sense of fearlessness about technical issues and new ideas 
technical writing and presentation skills, a sense of professionalism and project management 
to support colleagues and value a collegial, challenging, fun and interdisciplinary environment.
