&nbsp; I am a geodynamicist working on two-phase flow magma dynamics at tectonic boundaries such as subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges and am expanding this research into the planetary realm with the goal to understand dynamic habitability. Currently, I am a assistant professor at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology. At Scripps Institution of Oceanography, I worked on understanding the depth of mid-ocean ridges through Earth's evolution and the two-phase study of melt focusing at mid-ocean ridges with advisors Dave Stegman, James Day and Marc Spiegelman. As a Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Institution for Science, I worked on carbon fluxes at subduction zones employing a combination of two phase flow and geochemical thermodynamics with the late Erik Hauri.

I highly encourage everyone in Geoscience to take a look at the online program for Unlearning Racism in Geoscience or [URGE](www.urgeoscience.org). It is an 8-session "community-wide journal reading and policy-design curriculum to help Geoscientists unlearn racism and improve accessibility, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (AJEDI) in our discipline." Even if you did not get to take part, all the paper readings, video interviews and deliverables by all the Pods across the country/globe are posted on the website. I am happy to chat/discuss if you want as I am continually learning too.    

Here is the living [group vision document](https://joycesim.github.io/GroupVision/) that serves as a guide with regards to expectations, vision and policies in the group.

### Mitchell McMillan (Postdoctoral Scholar May 2022 -- Present)
<img align="right" src="/image/MitchellMcMillan.jpg" alt="Mitchell" title="Mitchell" width="400" />    

&nbsp; I am a geologist interested in the interactions among tectonics, lithology, and erosion that control the evolution of Earth’s surface. My research includes geologic mapping and eolian geomorphology in the Central Andes, geodynamic modelling, and low-temperature thermochronology. My current focus is on understanding the behavior of aqueous fluids in continental subduction zones, especially as they facilitate chemical reactions in the upper plate. Reactions such as eclogitization and flux melting may be significant drivers of the geodynamics of mountain belts. [Website](https://www.mitchell-mcmillan.com/)

### Amita Anand (Georgia Tech Undergraduate Fall 2024 -- Present)
<img align="right" src="/image/AmitaAnand.png" alt="Amita" title="Amita" width="250" />    

I am a 4th year mathematics major from New Jersey. Within math I am interested in probability theory, statistics, and dynamical systems. I want to apply the pure math I have learned to geophysics to understand how the Earth works through modeling and simulation.
