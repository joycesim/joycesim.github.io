## Opportunities
For Prospective Students and Postdocs

I am looking for qualified, highly motivated students (undergraduate, MS, and PhD) and postdocs. Please email me for information about current or upcoming opportunities in my lab and include a CV. Students with a background in Earth science, geophysics, mechanical engineering and closely related fields are encouraged to apply. I highly encourage underrepresented minorites to contact me with any questions and to apply. No GRE required :) 

The Earth and Atmospheric Science department at Georgia Tech was selected as [one of the inaugural AGU Bridge partner institutions](https://fromtheprow.agu.org/agu-announces-2020-bridge-program-partners/). The application is open to underrepresented minorities (African American, Hispanic, American Indian, Pacific Islander, Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian) and opens mid December 2020 for Fall 2021 admission. Application is free and is shared with all partner institutions. For more information on the AGU bridge program, please go to the [website](https://www.agu.org/bridge-program#3).

Undergraduates are invited to apply for a ten-week research program hosted by Georgia Tech School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (EAS) during Summer 2021. Learn more [here](https://easreu.eas.gatech.edu/)!

### Postdoctoral Fellow position in Computational Geodynamics at Georgia Institute of Technology
[Apply here!](https://careers.hprod.onehcm.usg.edu/psc/careers/CAREERS/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM_FL.HRS_CG_SEARCH_FL.GBL?Page=HRS_APP_JBPST_FL&Action=U&FOCUS=Applicant&SiteId=03000&JobOpeningId=230846&PostingSeq=1&) 

Postdoctoral Research Fellow position in Computational Geodynamics
Georgia Institute of Technology
Atlanta, Georgia, USA

The School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology is seeking a postdoctoral scholar in Computational Geophysics/Geodynamics, specializing in numerical modeling of tectonic and/or planetary processes. The candidate must hold a PhD in geophysics, physics, mathematics, mechanical engineering, or related field. Familiarity with the development of scientific codes along with a strong understanding of theory and numerical methods used in geodynamic modelling is highly desired. The specific research topic is open and will be chosen based on the mutual interests of the postdoctoral scholar and the supervisor. Access to high-performance computing resources is available through the Partnership for an Advanced Computing Environment (PACE) at Georgia Tech.

This is a fixed term position for 18-months to begin no later than Spring 2022. The postdoctoral scholar will be supervised by Dr Shi Joyce Sim (https://joycesim.github.io/).  

Georgia Tech provides equal opportunity to all faculty, staff, students, and all other members of the Georgia Tech community, including applicants for admission and/or employment, contractors, volunteers, and participants in institutional programs, activities, or services. Georgia Tech complies with all applicable laws and regulations governing equal opportunity in the workplace and in educational activities.

I am a geodynamicist working on two-phase flow magma dynamics at tectonic boundaries such as subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges. I am a research scientist at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology. At Scripps Institution of Oceanography, I worked on understanding the depth of mid-ocean ridges through Earth's evolution and the two-phase study of melt focusing at mid-ocean ridges with advisors Dave Stegman, James Day and Marc Spiegelman. As a Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Institution for Science, I worked on carbon fluxes at subduction zones employing a combination of two phase flow and geochemical thermodynamics with Erik Hauri.

I highly encourage everyone in Geoscience to take a look at the online program for Unlearning Racism in Geoscience or [URGE](www.urgeoscience.org). It is an 8-session "community-wide journal reading and policy-design curriculum to help Geoscientists unlearn racism and improve accessibility, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (AJEDI) in our discipline." Even if you did not get to take part, all the paper readings, video interviews and deliverables by all the Pods across the country/globe are posted on the website. I am happy to chat/discuss if you want as I am continually learning too :) 

### Rosen Ting-Ying Yu (Georgia Tech Computer Engineering undergraduate Fall 2021)
<img src="/image/Rosenprofilepic.jpg" alt="Rosen" title="Rosen" width="300" />

I am a junior at Georgia Tech majoring in Electrical Engineering. My passion for computational simulations and eath science inspired me to apply my engineering background to learn more about the geophysics of the Earth.

### Keneni Godana (Summer REU Programme 2021)
Keneni is a rising Earth Science senior at University of illinois, Chicago and will be working on understanding how radiogenic heating affected seafloor subsidence and therefore ocean basins during the early Earth as part of the Georgia Tech EAS Summer REU program. Keneni will be presenting this work at AGU Fall meeting 2021. 

### Susan Harrison (Georgia Tech EAS Undergraduate Summer research 2021)
Susan is an EAS undergraduate who will work on understanding spectral differences from magma waves between symmetric and asymmetric two-phase flow mid ocean ridge models. Susan will be presenting this work at AGU fall meeting 2021.
