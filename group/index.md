## Opportunities
For Prospective Students and Postdocs

I am looking for qualified, highly motivated students (undergraduate, MS, and PhD) and postdocs. Please email me for information about current or upcoming opportunities in my lab and include a CV. For students, the application dateline is __1st January 2021__. Students with a background in Earth science, geophysics, mechanical engineering and closely related fields are encouraged to apply. I highly encourage underrepresented minorites to contact me with any questions and to apply.

The Earth and Atmospheric Science department at Georgia Tech was selected as [one of the inaugural AGU Bridge partner institutions](https://fromtheprow.agu.org/agu-announces-2020-bridge-program-partners/). The application is open to underrepresented minorities (African American, Hispanic, American Indian, Pacific Islander, Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian) and opens mid December 2020 for Fall 2021 admission. Application is free and is shared with all partner institutions. For more information on the AGU bridge program, please go to the [website](https://www.agu.org/bridge-program#3).

I am a geodynamicist working on two-phase flow magma dynamics at tectonic boundaries such as subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges. I am a research scientist at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology. At Scripps Institution of Oceanography, I worked on understanding the depth of mid-ocean ridges through Earth's evolution and the two-phase study of melt focusing at mid-ocean ridges with advisors Dave Stegman, James Day and Marc Spiegelman. As a Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Institution for Science, I worked on carbon fluxes at subduction zones employing a combination of two phase flow and geochemical thermodynamics with Erik Hauri.
