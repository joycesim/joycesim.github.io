### [Tech to Teaching](https://ctl.gatech.edu/tech-teaching/) (Spring 2024) Center for Teaching and Learning

### EAS 4312/6312 Geodynamics (Spring 2025)

### EAS 4610 Earth Systems Modeling (Fall 2025)

This course covers the fundamentals of numerical methods and their application to problems in Earth sciences. Course content includes how to solve (on a computer) differential equations (ordinary and partial), integrals, root-finding problems, and linear algebra. This course is targeted at undergraduate students in Earth Atmospheric Sciences, and is the undergraduate equivalent of EAS 6130. Learning objective: At the end of this course, students should be able to use basic numerical methods to solve simple equations or model systems of equations. Students should also have more confidence with using MATLAB or Python to program simple numerical methods for solving fairly well-behaved problems in integration, differential equations, root-finding, and linear algebra.
