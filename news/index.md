August 2020: Official start at Georgia Institute of Technology! I am looking for motivated and enthusiastic students who are interested in applying fluid dynamics (physics, math and numerical modeling) to geologic problems! Postdoc too! Checkout [Geophysics@GeorgiaTech](http://geophysics.eas.gatech.edu/)! Please feel free to email me to chat. 

May 2020: Hot off the press! Papers on [melt focusing beneath mid-ocean ridges](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL087349) and on [bathymetry in the Southeast Indian ridge](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pepi.2020.106486) are both out!
