### Graduate students
Please email me for information about current or upcoming opportunities in my lab and include a CV. Students with a background in Earth science, geophysics, mechanical engineering and closely related fields are encouraged to apply. I highly encourage underrepresented minorites to contact me with any questions and to apply. No GRE required.

The Earth and Atmospheric Science department at Georgia Tech was selected as [one of the inaugural AGU Bridge partner institutions](https://fromtheprow.agu.org/agu-announces-2020-bridge-program-partners/). The application is open to underrepresented minorities (African American, Hispanic, American Indian, Pacific Islander, Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian) and opens mid December 2020 for Fall 2021 admission. Application is free and is shared with all partner institutions. For more information on the AGU bridge program, please go to the [website](https://www.agu.org/bridge-program#3).
