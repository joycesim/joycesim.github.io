# {{page.title}}
I am a geodynamicist working on two-phase flow magma dynamics at tectonic boundaries such as subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges. I am a research scientist at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology. At Scripps Institution of Oceanography, I worked on understanding the depth of mid-ocean ridges through Earth's evolution and the two-phase study of melt focusing at mid-ocean ridges with advisors Dave Stegman, James Day and Marc Spiegelman. As a Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Institution for Science, I worked on carbon fluxes at subduction zones employing a combination of two phase flow and geochemical thermodynamics with Erik Hauri.
