# {{page.title}}
I am a geodynamicist working on two-phase flow magma dynamics at tectonic boundaries such as subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges. I will be starting a research scientist position at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology in August 2020. My doctoral thesis work entitled: "The depth of mid-ocean ridges through Earth's evolution and a two-phase study of melt focusing at mid-ocean ridges" was done at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego, with advisors Dave Stegman and James Day. As a Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO) postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Institution for Science, I worked on carbon fluxes at subduction zones employing a combination of two phase flow and geochemical thermodynamics.
